# valid_attrs so far include date, narr, debit, credit.
# (narr means narration or description)
# Dummies are merely for your eyes (they could be delimiters in the
# statement or some unnecessary details).
# The regex  is "glued" together from top to bottom within {}, so the order
# is important. For the above example the final regex would be
# 'valid_attr1valid_attr2dummyanother_dummy'
#
# Study your bank's statement thoroughly.
#
# WARNING: Do not use named capture-groups with the names same as the
# valid_attrs specified above. They are reserved.

# Below are 2 real examples for the text statement of 2 banks in India.
