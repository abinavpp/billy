# This is a comment.
# Comments are only allowed outside cat definitions.
#
# The syntax of cat-regex-list definition is
# <cat_name> {
#   <regex_1>
#   <regex_2>
# }
# which makes <regex_1> and <regex_2> associated with <cat_name>, to be
# matched with the narration of each entries.
#
# The syntax of cat-hook definition is 
# <already_defined_cat_name> <hook_type> {
#   <hook_type_instr>
#   <hook_type_instr>
# }
# The only implemented hook is the overall hook that only affects the
# overall output at the end.
#
# The only reserved cat is __uncat__ which holds the entries uncaught by the
# user-defined. You can add hooks to it, but do not define a cat-regex-list
# for it!

# The overall hook instructions affect only the final summary.

# donate misc debit_total 200
# does misc{debit_total} += 200, __uncat__{debit_total} -= 200
#
#
# donate
# ------
# donate <whom> <what> [amt]
# if amt is empty then the remainder amount will be donated
#
# del
# ---
# del <what> [amt]
# if amt is empty then the remainder amount will be deleted.
